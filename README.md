Random Forest is a machine learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions or classifications. It does this by using randomness in the data and features for each tree, and then averaging or voting on the predictions of these trees to produce a robust and reliable final prediction.
It's a popular choice for a wide range of machine learning tasks due to its effectiveness in reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.Random Forest is a powerful machine learning technique that uses a collection of decision trees, randomness, and ensemble methods to make accurate predictions and avoid overfitting. It's widely used in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and natural language processing
